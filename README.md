# HandsDeep
This is an implementation of the paper "Hands Deep in Deep Learning for Hand Pose Estimation".

Reference: Oberweger, Markus, Paul Wohlhart, and Vincent Lepetit. 
"Hands deep in deep learning for hand pose estimation." 
arXiv preprint arXiv:1502.06807 (2015).

The code is written in Julia by using Knet library. 
It is my term project for the deep learning class in Ko√ß university
